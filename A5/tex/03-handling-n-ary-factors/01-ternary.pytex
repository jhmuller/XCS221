\item \points{2a}
Suppose we have a CSP with three variables $X_1, X_2, X_3$ with the same domain
$\{0,1,2\}$ and a ternary constraint $[X_1 + X_2 + X_3 \le K]$. How can we
reduce this CSP to one with only unary and/or binary constraints? Explain what
auxiliary variables we need to introduce, what their domains are, what
unary/binary factors you'll add, and why your scheme works. Add a graph if you
think that'll better explain your scheme.

{\em Hint: draw inspiration from the example of enforcing $[X_i=1\ \text{for
exactly one}\ i]$ which is in the first CSP lecture.}
