Example 1:
=== a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma .
Truth: 1, Prediction: -1 [WRONG]

Note the word "lack" was in the text with very negative weights, but in this case I think the "lacks" refers to a different movie


Example 2:
=== 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
Truth: -1, Prediction: 1 [WRONG]


Here the words "sweet" and "home" provided very positive weights but they were just the names of another movie


Example 3:
=== wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture .
Truth: 1, Prediction: -1 [WRONG]

Here "never" and "boring" gave strong negative values, but note they were used together to mean a positive sentiment.


Example 4:
=== even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .
Truth: -1, Prediction: 1 [WRONG]

Both "patience" and "shapeless" had positive weights.  Maybe not so strange for "patience" but wrong for how it is used.
Hard to see why "shapeless" has a positive weight

Example 5:
=== wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin .
Truth: 1, Prediction: -1 [WRONG]

Odd, but two of the most negative weights here were "feel" and "ending"
